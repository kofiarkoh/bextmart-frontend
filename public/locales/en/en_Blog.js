            <p>These features are possible thanks to a new opt-in mechanism we’re adding in React 18. It’s called “concurrent rendering” and it lets React prepare multiple versions of the UI at the same time. This change is mostly behind-the-scenes, but it unlocks new possibilities to improve both real and perceived performance of your app.</p>
            <p>If you’ve been following our research into the future of React (we don’t expect you to!), you might have heard of something called “concurrent mode” or that it might break your app. In response to this feedback from the community, we’ve redesigned the upgrade strategy for gradual adoption. Instead of an all-or-nothing “mode”, concurrent rendering will only be enabled for updates triggered by one of the new features. In practice, this means<span> </span><strong>you will be able to adopt React 18 without rewrites and try the new features at your own pace.</strong></p>`

            <p>Upgrading to the new transform is completely optional, but it has a few benefits:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>With the new transform, you can<span> </span><strong>use JSX without importing React</strong>.</li>
            <li>Depending on your setup, its compiled output may<span> </span><strong>slightly improve the bundle size</strong>.</li>
            <li>It will enable future improvements that<span> </span><strong>reduce the number of concepts</strong><span> </span>you need to learn React.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>This upgrade will not change the JSX syntax and is not required.</strong><span> </span>The old JSX transform will keep working as usual, and there are no plans to remove the support for it.</p>

            <p>For the past seven years, React upgrades have been “all-or-nothing”. Either you stay on an old version, or you upgrade your whole app to a new version. There was no in-between.</p>
            <p>This has worked out so far, but we are running into the limits of the “all-or-nothing” upgrade strategy. Some API changes, for example, deprecating the<span> </span><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/legacy-context.html">legacy context API</a>, are impossible to do in an automated way. Even though most apps written today don’t ever use them, we still support them in React. We have to choose between supporting them in React indefinitely or leaving some apps behind on an old version of React. Both of these options aren’t great.</p>
            <p>So we wanted to provide another option.</p>
            <p><strong>React 17 enables gradual React upgrades.</strong><span> </span>When you upgrade from React 15 to 16 (or, soon, from React 16 to 17), you would usually upgrade your whole app at once. This works well for many apps. But it can get increasingly challenging if the codebase was written more than a few years ago and isn’t actively maintained. And while it’s possible to use two versions of React on the page, until React 17 this has been fragile and caused problems with events.</p>
            <p>We’re fixing many of those problems with React 17. This means that<span> </span><strong>when React 18 and the next future versions come out, you will now have more options</strong>. The first option will be to upgrade your whole app at once, like you might have done before. But you will also have an option to upgrade your app piece by piece. For example, you might decide to migrate most of your app to React 18, but keep some lazy-loaded dialog or a subroute on React 17.</p>
            <p>This doesn’t mean you<span> </span><em>have to</em><span> </span>do gradual upgrades. For most apps, upgrading all at once is still the best solution. Loading two versions of React — even if one of them is loaded lazily on demand — is still not ideal. However, for larger apps that aren’t actively maintained, this option may make sense to consider, and React 17 enables those apps to not get left behind.</p>
            <p>To enable gradual updates, we’ve needed to make some changes to the React event system. React 17 is a major release because these changes are potentially breaking. In practice, we’ve only had to change fewer than twenty components out of 100,000+ so<span> </span><strong>we expect that most apps can upgrade to React 17 without too much trouble</strong>.<span> </span><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tell us</a><span> </span>if you run into problems.</p>
